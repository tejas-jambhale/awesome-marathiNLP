Curated List of Natural Language Processing resources focused on the Marathi Language

This repository contains tools, datasets and tutorials to aid NLP research in Marathi. This repo was created to help developers get started on working in Marathi NLP. These are some resources that I believe can help increase the amount and depth of research done in Marathi.

Marathi is an Indian Language predominantly spoken in the state of Maharashtra, India and is based on the Devnagiri script with around 83 million speakers.
